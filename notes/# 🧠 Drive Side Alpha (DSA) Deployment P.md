# 🧠 Drive Side Alpha (DSA) Deployment Plan

## ✅ Current Architecture

### 📦 Backend
- **Plotly Dash dashboard**
  - Hosted on **AWS EC2**
  - Modular clustering overlays
  - Summary stats and toggles
- **Flask or FastAPI backend**
  - Optional: JWT-based auth
  - Optional: API endpoints for data queries

### 🌐 Frontend
- **Webflow site**
  - Public-facing marketing and landing pages
  - Embeds Dash dashboard via `<iframe>`
  - Responsive layout and branding

### 🔐 Authentication
- **Memberstack**
  - Handles customer login/signup
  - Gates access to iframe/dashboard
  - Integrates with Stripe for paid plans

### 💳 Payments
- **Stripe**
  - One-time and subscription payments
  - Connected to Memberstack for access control

## 🧠 Notes & Design Ethos
- Modular architecture reflects emotional sovereignty and technical clarity
- Avoids over-functioning in frontend—outsources layout, auth, and payments
- Focus remains on backend intelligence, clustering logic, and user experience
