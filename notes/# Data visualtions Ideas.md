# Data visualtions Ideas


## flight Cluster 
- So i think this would be good for a timeline graph 
- two different time line graphs might be good because i have two different cluster sizes
- Maybe some high level Score cards that tell's the total number of flights for a day I don't think i have that 
- or having the tool tip to say how many flights are in specific cluster
- I think maybe have in 24 hour period on the x-axis and on the y-axis have be for different days of the week

## event clusters
- So scatter Map 
- then a data table
- Date filter or slider
- call back so the data table and the scatter map can interact with each other
-
